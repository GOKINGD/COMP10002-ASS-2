# COMP10002-ASS-2
#comp10002 Foundations of Algorithms 
#Semester 2, 2022 Assignment 2 
#Learning Outcomes 
In this project, you will demonstrate your understanding of dynamic memory and linked data structures (Chapter 10) and extend your program design, testing, and debugging skills. You will also learn about the problem of process discovery and implement a simple algorithm for discovering a process model from event data.
#Process Discovery
Process mining is a relatively young research discipline that combines studies of inferences from data in data
mining and machine learning with process modeling and analysis to discover, monitor, and improve real-world
processes. The studied processes get formally captured in process models.
